Comments:
Name Header: Name Header is present and in the correct format

Fuction print:  Correct fuction header

		Uses a WHILE loop and stops when a nullptr is encountered

Fuction reversePrint: Correct fuction header

		      Uses a while loop and traverses the linklist in reverse
		      Stops when a nullptr is encountered

Fuction front:  Correct fuction header

		One line statement that returns the first value

Fuction back:   Correct fuciton header

		One line statement that returns the first value

Fuction copyToList: Correct fuction header

		    Identifier is not descrpitive, it does not 
		    state that there is more than one list

		    Copies the fuction from the last element 
		    in the list and uses a while loop to 
		    traverse the linklist

Fuction insertInOrder:  Incorrect header (uses const int instead of just int)
			Has a condition for empty list

			There should be a sequence of IF/ELSE statements, 
			rather than a sequence of IF/ ELSE IF statements.

			The case when the list is empty was considered.

			The case when the new node should be inserted to
			the left of the first node was considered but doesn't 
			set the newNode to point to the previous last element

			The case when the new node should be inserted somewhere
			in the middle or the end was considered but uses 3 different
			pointers to go through the list and does not use all the 
			pointers in each of his if and else if statements in his while
			loop even though two of three of the pointers where 
			declared beforehand (-1)
			
			Variable count increases everytime the 
			the insertToOrder fuction is called 
			instead of only when there is new data (-1)

			
Other errors: 	Variables are not declated right before using them
		(begin pointer for if(begin->getData() > element) )
		(end pointer for if(end->getData() < element) ) (-1)

		Poor indentation in the insertToOrder fuction (-1)

Other:  Incorrect Count for all the test (-1)

	Incorrect Print backwards output for Insert 7 amd Insert 5
	(Loses the second to last Node) (-1)

	Created too many unnessarary pointers in the insertToOrder fuction 
	(3 different pointers: begin, end, and newNode)
